                Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island
                has an area of less than 500 square miles, the terrain is varied
                and includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor,
                lush tropical rainforests, and a mountainous interior that includes
                a small, active volcano. Taniti has an indigenous population of
                about 20,000. Until a recent increase in tourism, most the Tanitian
                economy was dominated by fishing or agriculture
